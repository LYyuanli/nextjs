First and foremost, most of the code are generated using Cursor.
I manually validate them and corret the mistakes.

Next.js
SSR enables faster first screen load and better SEO.

Redux store
No specific reason to choose this one. Any store is fine.

Tailwind
more declarative style names, no need to deal with css modules, built-in breakpoints support for different screen sizes

react-infinite-scroll-component
Easier API to use to implement infinite scroll.

@mui/material
This is chosen by AI to create the price slider. Any library should be fine for me.



No testing code is created.
To be honest, I haven't used any testing library/framework for React project.
I can generate some with AI, but I don't think that's what you want to see.
